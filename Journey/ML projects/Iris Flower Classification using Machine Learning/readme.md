# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to classify iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements. The famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) is used for training and testing multiple classification models.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build and compare the performance of different machine learning models for predicting the species of iris flowers. The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

The target variable is the species of the flower:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica
